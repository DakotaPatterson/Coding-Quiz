# Coding-Quiz

A coding quiz to help familiarize students with a coding assessment.

## Description

This project is a coding quiz to help students with their knowledge of JavaScript. My motivation was to make a webpage that allowed a user to study JavaScript in a fun quiz that allowed for competition among peers. This webpage allows the user to select the start quiz and go through questions to practice their coding ability while also racing the clock to get the best score possible. I have learned that making sure the Javascript is interactive to the user and displays with visually appealing css makes a webpage unique and fun to traverse.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The best way to use this is to click the [Start Button](assets/startButton.png) and then answer the questions as they appear on the screen.

Once this is complete the score of the user will be displayed along with an area for entering the initials to be displayed on the Highscore List.

If you would like to replay the quiz you would just need to click the [Go Back Button](assets/GoBackButton.png) to start again.
